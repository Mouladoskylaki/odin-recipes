# odin-recipes
The Odin Recipes Webpage is a website that displays a variety of recipes, each with its own dedicated page. The main page provides links to individual recipes, and each recipe page includes a list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions.

Skills Demonstrated
Upon completing this project, I have demonstrated the following basic web development skills:

HTML Structure: I utilized HTML to create the structure of the webpage, including elements such as headings, paragraphs, and links.

Unordered Lists (<ul>): I implemented unordered lists to organize the ingredients and steps for each recipe.

List Items (<li>): Each ingredient and step is listed as a separate list item, showcasing my ability to use list elements effectively.
