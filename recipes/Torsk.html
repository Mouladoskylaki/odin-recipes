    Torsk is a Scandinavian dish of poached and broiled cod with butter. This recipe uses frozen fish; defrosting is not necessary. Be sure to use butter, 
    as there is too much water in margarine.
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    6 cups water, or more as needed
    
    1 cup white sugar
    
    2 tablespoons salt
    
    6 (6 ounce) fillets cod
    
    1 Â½ cups butter, melted
    
    1 dash paprika
    
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    Preheat the broiler. Lightly grease a cookie sheet.
    
    Mix together water, sugar, and salt in a large saucepan. Add fillets to water mixture; add more water to fully submerge fillets if needed. Bring water to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil for 3 to 5 minutes.
    
    Remove fillets from water and blot dry on paper towels. Brush with 6 tablespoons melted butter; sprinkle with paprika.
    
    Broil in the preheated broiler until fillets are golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes per inch of thickness. Serve with remaining melted butter.
