    <p>Torsk is a Scandinavian dish of poached and broiled cod with butter. This recipe uses frozen fish; defrosting is not necessary. Be sure to use butter, 
    as there is too much water in margarine.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>6 cups water, or more as needed</li>
    
    <li> cup white sugar</li>
    
    <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
    
    <li>6 (6 ounce) fillets cod</li>
    
    <li>Â½ cups butter, melted</li>
    
    <li>dash paprika</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat the broiler. Lightly grease a cookie sheet.</li>
    
    <li>Mix together water, sugar, and salt in a large saucepan. Add fillets to water mixture; add more water to fully submerge fillets if needed. Bring water to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    
    <li>Remove fillets from water and blot dry on paper towels. Brush with 6 tablespoons melted butter; sprinkle with paprika.</li>
    
    <li>Broil in the preheated broiler until fillets are golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes per inch of thickness. Serve with remaining melted butter.</li>
    </ol>
